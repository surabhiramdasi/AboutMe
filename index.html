										<!-- <h2 class="major">Re-design a Rolling Resistance Machine for Tire Testing</h2> -->
										<p>Hi, my name is Surabhi Ramdasi. I work as a Senior Mechanical Engineer at Cummins Inc. 
											Cars, Airplanes, Rockets, Robots fascinated me when I was young. Hence, I decided to choose Mechanical Engineering as my major when I started pursuing 
											my undergraduate engineering degree at Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune, India. The highlight of my education was to get an opportunity to
											work on a missile development program in the Defense segment - Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) - as part of my senior year capstone project. I was also
											a part of the Collegiate SAE Baja team during my junior and senior year. <br>
											After graduating, I worked at John Deere India Pvt. Ltd. This was a great opportunity to learn about industrial engineering. I had the chance to spend a lot of time 
											on the assembly line and to get familiar with the plant operations. As a part of this role, I also worked with global John Deere factories supporting 
											different functions like assembly operations, sourcing and procurement, and ergonomic design. <br> 
											I moved to the US in 2014 to pursue my Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech. I specialized in solid mechanics and finite element analysis.  I redesigned 
											a rolling resistance machine for tire testing as part of my thesis - I used a lot of Solidworks and Abaqus for this work. I interned at Cummins Inc. in the R&D design 
											team while pursuing my Master's. I became proficient in Creo and Ansys while working in this team.    
											After graduating from Virginia Tech in 2016, I started working at Cummins Inc. as a Product Development Engineer in Current Product Improvement. I worked on three different engine 
											platforms and dealt with multiple OEMs from the on-highway automotive segment on a lot of fast-paced projects. I led projects with varied scope spanning from design 
											evaluation, sourcing, manufacturing, warranty failures to customer negotiations. <br>
											I moved back into the R&D group in 2018 as a structural analysis engineer. This role gave me an amazing opportunity to use the knowledge I had gained during my Master's. As a 
											part of this role, I mostly support NPI prorgams. I have so far worked on diesel engines, natural gas engines and fuel cell powertrains. I was also fortunate enough to lead the 
											development efforts for a diesel engine cylinder head, where I collaborated with design engineers, CFD analysts, validation engineers and TPLs to deliver a robust design. I also
											work on a lot of functional excellence initiatives which gives me an opportunity to mentor and work with Cummins employees from UK, Brazil and India. One of my functional
											excellence initiative turned into a Six Sigma project and has shown tremendous potential in terms of cost and time savings. <br>
											Going forward, I would love to use my skills for projects pertaining to cleaner energy - like electrification, fuel cells. In addition, because I love 
											learning new things I would love to break into a different industry where I get a chance to work in a more competitive space. My short term goal is to be able to 
											drive technology roadmaps as a TPL.
